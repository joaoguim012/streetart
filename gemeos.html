    <h1> About Os Gemeos</h1> <br>
    <h2>Os Gêmeos are Brasilian brothers that were born in São Paulo, Brasil (Otavio and Gustavo Pandolfo). They are graffiti artists and identical twin brothers. They started painting graffiti in 1987 and gradually became a main influence in the local scene, helping to define Brasil's own style.
        Their work often features yellow-skinned characters - taken from the yellow tinge both of the twins have in their dreams - but is otherwise diverse and ranges from tags to complicated murals.
        Subjects range from family portraits to commentary on São Paulo's and Brasil's social and political circumstances, as well as Brasilian folklore.
        Their graffiti style was influenced by both traditional hip hop style and the Brazilian culture. Now their art has spread world wide, from Japan to Germany</h2>
